values are from 0 to 99
size of 100

L - left turn - decrements to the lower value
R - right turn - increments to the higher value

circular queue of size 100

the pointer is at 50 at the start: 
    start at 0 and end is at 50

counter to calculate the no.of times the end reaches zero index:
 if end == o or end == start then counter++

 return counter

 input - input file
 reads each line breaks the string into 2 parts - string part and intege part
 string part indicates decrements or increments and the integer part indicates the value that is supposed to be 
 incremented or decremented.



create a class to accept the input file and break the password



Part 2 

Iterate the pointer value times (if that make sense)
if the indicator is L - iterate through the arr value times and decrement the pointer and note the no of times the pointer hits 0
vice versa for R - increment the pointer

make sure the pointer resets to 99 after trying to decrement below 0
and to 0 when the pointer tries to increment above 99
